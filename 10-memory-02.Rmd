# Memory game, part 2 {#seminar10}

By the time we finished our previous seminar, you had the code that created a single "card" with a given image at a given location and you were able to interact with it (flip-flopping it). Now, we need to extend the code so that we have eight cards that we can open only two at a time. If cards match (have same `"filename"` field), we remove them. If cards do not match, we simply turn them over.

Before we start, create a new folder _Memory02_ for exercise files. Copy _Images_ subfolder, as well as the `utilities.py` and _exercise11.py_ (rename it to _exercise01.py_, as we will use the latter as the staring point). Also, download the [Jupyter notebook](notebooks/Seminar 10. Memory game, part 2.ipynb), which you will use to experiment with functions and do exercises. You will need to upload it along with other files.

## Getting list of image files.
For a single card, we simply hard-coded the name of the image file, as well as its location. However, for a real game (or an experiment) we would like to be more flexible and automatically determine which files we have in the _Images_ folder. For this, you need to use [os.listdir(path=".")](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir) function that, you've guess it, returns a list with filenames of _all_ the files in a folder specified by path. By default, it is a current path (`path="."`). However, you can use either a relative path - `os.listdir("Images")`, assuming that _Images_ is a subfolder in your current directory - or an absolute path `os.listdir("E:/Teaching/Python/MemoryGame/Images")` (in my case). In Jupyter, write a single line code to get the list of files in the _Images_ folder. Use _relative_ path, if it is in a subfolder relative to your Jupyter notebook, or use an _absolute_ path, if it is in a different folder. Do not forget to `import os` before you run the code, of course!

You should have gotten a list of 8 files that are coded as _[r|l][index].png_, where _r_ or _l_ denote the side the chicken is looking at. However, for our game we need only four images (4 Ã— 2 = 8 cards). Therefore, we need to select a subset of them. For example, a random four or chicken looking to the left or to the right only. Here, let us work with chicken looking to the left, meaning that we need only to pick files that start with "l". To make this list filtering more efficient, we will use [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions).


## List comprehension
List comprehension provide an elegant and easy-to-read way to create, modify and/or filter elements of the list creating a new list. The general structure is
```python
new_list = [<transform-the-item> for item in old_list if <condition-given-the-item>]
```
Let us look at examples to understand how it works. Imagine that you have a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3]` and you need increment each number by 1^[A very arbitrary example!]. You can do it by creating a new list and adding 1 to each item in the <transform-the-item> part:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers_plus_1 = [item + 1 for item in numbers]
```

Note that this is equivalent to
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers_plus_1 = []
for item in numbers:
    numbers_plus_1.append(item + 1)
```

Or, imagine that you need to convert each item to a string. You can do it simply as
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers_as_strings = [str(item) for item in numbers]
```
What would be an equivalent form using a normal for loop? Write both versions of code in Jupiter cells and check that the results are the same.

Now, implement the code below using list comprehension. Check that results match.
```python
strings = ['1', '2', '3']
numbers = []
for astring in strings:
    numbers.append(int(astring) + 10)
```

::: {.infobox .practice}
Do exercise #3 in Jupyter notebook.
:::

As noted above, you can also use conditional statement to filter which items are passed to the new list. In our numbers example, we can retain numbers that are greater than 1
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers_greater_than_1 = [item for item in numbers if item > 1]
```

Sometimes, the same statement is written in three lines, instead of one, to make reading easier:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers_greater_than_1 = [item 
                          for item in numbers
                          if item > 1]
```

You can of course combine the transformation and filtering in a single statement. Create code that filters out all items below 2 and adds 4 to them.

## Getting list of relevant files
Now that you know about list comprehensions, you can easily create a list of files of chicken looking left, _i.e._ with filenames that start with "l". Use [str.startswith()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith) for filtering, store the list in `filenames` variable. Put you code into a Jupyter cell.

This gives us a nice list of eight files but we need each name twice. There are several ways of making but we will use list operations for this.

### List operations
Python lists implement two operations:

* Adding two lists together: `<list1> + <list2>`.
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
a + b
```

gives a _new_ list with items `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6]`. Note that this is not equivalent to [extend](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) method `a.extend(b)`! The `+` creates a _new_ list, `.extend()` extends the original list `a`.

* List multiplication/replication: `<list> * <integer-value>` creates a _new_ list by replicating the original one `<integer-value>` times. For example: 
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = 4
a * b
```
will give you `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.

Use either operations or `.extend()` method to create the new list where each filename is repeated twice. Hint, you can apply list multiplication directly to the filenames list you created via list comprehension.

## Lots of cards, using list enumeration
Now that we have a list of filenames, we can create a list of cards out of it. This list will replace your single `card` variable.  Name the new list `cards` and create it either using an empty list + for loop or using list comprehensions. Inside the loop you creating each card using its filename and index (see below) and append it to the `cards` list (or it is added automatically, if you use comprehensions).

You can get the index of each filename (and, therefore, it position on the screen) via [enumerate()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate), which is a generator that returns a tuple of `(index, item)`. For example, test the example below that prints one letter at a time with its index:
```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for index, letter in enumerate(letters):
    print('%d: %s'%(index, letter))
```

Once you created the list of cards, you should draw _all_ of them inside the main loop. You already have a line that draws a single `single_card`. You should wrap this call with a for loop that loops over all `cards` and uses `single_card` as an iterator variable. Your code should look roughly as this
```
# import libraries
# open window and create the mouse
# get filenames for chicken looking left 
# create all cards

gameover = False
while not gameover:
    # draw all cards
    
    # check keys
    
    # mouse processing - COMMENT IT OUT FOR A MOMENT
```

## Mouse interaction for every card
Our mouse interaction was based on the index of our only card and checking that it matches the mouse click. However, now we have eight cards that cover the _entire_ window. Thus, it does not matter where exactly the player clicked, there is a card which needs to be turned over.  Modify your mouse click processing code so that if mouse left button is pressed, it computes an index of that location (it would be from 0 to 7), flips the card with that index in the list, waits for 0.1 seconds (our hack from last time, we won't need it soon).

::: {.infobox .program}
Put your code into _exercise02.py_.
:::

## Limiting flipping to just two cards
In the actual game, we are allow to only turn around _two_ cards at a time. We will either need an extra variable to know how many cards are face up already or do an on-the-fly scan through the list. Let us implement the extra variable solution. Create a new variable `faceup_n = 0` before the loop. Inside the mouse-click processing code, you need to implement the following logic:
```
if mouse.getPressed()[0]:
    # compute index of the mouse click
    # if card with this index is not face up already:
        # turn the card face up
        # increment the faceup_n variable
        # if faceup_n is equal to 2:
            # --- draw all cards ---
            # insert a pause of 0.5 seconds
            # turn all cards back
            # reset faceup_n to zero (as all cards are now with their backs up)
```

Note that we need to explicitly draw the cards again inside the condition (and don't forget to flip the window)! Otherwise, we turn the card back before we ever get to the drawing stage.

::: {.infobox .program}
Put your code into _exercise03.py_.
:::

## Remembering which cards were turned
Our initial implementation was to count the number of cards that player turned. This, however, means that we don't know which cards these were. Let us now store face-up cards in a new list called `faceup` that would replace the `faceup_n` variable. Initialize `faceup` with an empty list (just like you initialized `faceup_n` with 0). And, once the card is flipped, add it to this list. Once `faceup` list is 2 items long (use [len()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=len#len) function to get the length of the list), show the cards, wait for 0.5 seconds, turn cards in `faceup` list back, and [clear](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) the list.
```
if mouse.getPressed()[0]:
    # compute index of the mouse click
    # if card with this index is not face up already:
        # turn the card face up
        # add card to faceup list
        # if faceup list length is equal to 2:
            # --- draw all cards ---
            # insert a pause of 0.5 seconds
            # turn cards in faceup list back
            # clear faceup list
```

## "Visible" card flag
In our next step, we will remove the matching cards. However, in reality, we won't actually remove them, we just won't draw them and won't allow user to interact with them once they are "removed". To know whether we need to draw a particular card, we will add a new field `visible`. There are three (well, four) pieces of code which needs to be modified.

1. Add `visible` field to the dictionary in the `create_card()` function when making the card and set it to `True` by default.
2. When drawing cards, draw it only if `visible` field is `True`. By now you draw card in _two_ places, so both need to be appended.
3. In the code that processes the mouse click, when checking if the card hasn't been turned over yet, add "and it is visible" to the condition (in Python syntax, of course). So that it can be turned face up only if it is current face down and visible.

You should see no difference in the game, because as long as all cards are visible (and, at the moment, they always are) it works just like before.

Put your code into _utilities.py_ and _exercise05.py_.
:::

## "Removing" matching cards
By now we now which two cards were turned over (these are in `faceup` list) and if they match, which means that their filenames match, we can "remove" them by setting their `visible` field to `False`.

```
# if faceup list length is equal to 2:
    # --- draw all cards ---
    # insert a pause of 0.5 seconds

    # if cards match:
        # set cards visibility to False
    # else:
        # turn them back

    # clear faceup list
```

Test this and remember that we didn't shuffle the faces so they repeat in an orderly fashion, making it easy to open the pairs.

## Game over, if you run out of cards
Currently, our game can be exited by pressing _Escape_.  Let's add a more positive game-over outcome when you win because you matched all the cards! For this, we need to count how many cards are left on the table and modify the loop, so that it iterates only as long as the number of cards left is more than zero. For this,

1. Create a new variable `cards_left` before the loop start and set it to the total number of cards (length of the cards list).
2. Modify the while loop, adding the second condition that `cards_left` must be more than zero.
3. Decrease `cards_left` by 2, every time two cards are matched and "removed".

## Game over message
Currently, our game abruptly closes once all cards are removed. It would be much friendlier to add a simple "Game over" message and show it for couple of seconds. After the main loop but before closing the window, create and draw the [TextStim]((https://psychopy.org/api/visual/textstim.html) and use either `clock.wait(2)` or `event.waitKeys()` (your choice). However, make sure that this message is only shown if there were no cards left. Otherwise it was the escape button press and so no "game over" message for people who are too lazy to finish the game!

Put your code into _exercise08.py_.

## Counting attempts
It would be even more fun to check how many attempts it required for the player to match all cards. Create a new variable `attempts` and initialize it to zero before the main loop. Increase it by 1 every time the player turned two cards over (irrespective of whether they matched). Add the number of attempts to the "Game over" message.

Put your code into _exercise09.py_.

## Record time
Let us record the time it took the player to complete the task. For this we will use PsychoPy's [Clock](https://psychopy.org/api/clock.html#psychopy.clock.Clock) class, which is very straightforward. Simply create the `timer = clock.Clock()` before the main loop and then call its [getTime()](https://psychopy.org/api/clock.html#psychopy.clock.MonotonicClock.getTime) method to get the elapsed time in seconds. Add this information to the "game over" message.

## Randomness
The only boring thing about our game is that we know exactly where each chicken is. [Shuffle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle) the filenames list before you create the cards to turn it into a proper memory game.
