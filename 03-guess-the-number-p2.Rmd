# Guess the Number, the Sequel {#seminar03}

During our previous seminar, you programmed a single-attempt-only "Guess the Number" game. Now, you will expand to multiple attempts and will add other bells-and-whistles to make it more fun. Download the [exercise notebook](notebooks/Seminar 03. Guess the number, part 2.ipynb) before we start!

## While loop (Exercises 1-2) {#while-loop}
If you want to repeat something, you need to use loops. There are two types of loops: [while](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop) loop, which is repeated _while_ a condition is true, and [for](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop) loop that iterates over items (we will use it later).

The basic structure of a _while_ loop is
```{python eval=FALSE}
# statements before the loop

while <condition>:
    # statements inside are executed
    # repeatedly for as long as
    # the condition is True
    
# statements after the loop
```

The `<condition>` here is any expression that is evaluated to be either `True` or `False`, just like in an _if-elif-else_ conditional statement. 

**Do exercise #1**

Let us use _while_ loop, so that the player keeps guessing until finally getting it right. You can copy-paste the code you programmed during the last seminar or could redo it from scratch (I would strongly recommend you doing the latter!). The overall program structure should be the following
```{python eval=FALSE}
from random import randint

# generated random number and store in computer_pick variable
# print it out for debugging purposes
# get player input, convert it to an integer, and store

# while <players guess is not equal to the value the computer picked>:
    # print out "my number is smaller" or "my number is larger" using if-else statement
    
# print "Spot on!" (because if we got here that means guess is equal to the computer's pick)
```

**Do exercise #2.**

## Counting attempts (Exercise #3)

Now let us add a variable that will count the total number of attempts the player required. For this, create a new variable (call it `attempts` or something similar) _before the loop_ and initialize it `0`. Add `1` to it every time the player inputs the guess. After the loop, expand the `"Spot on!"` message you print out by adding information about the attempts count. Use string formatting to make things look nice, e.g. `"Spot on, you needed 5 attempts"`.

**Do exercise #3.**

## Breaking (and exiting, Exercise #4)
_While_ loop is continuously executed while the condition is `True` and, importantly, all code inside is executed before the condition is evaluated again. However, sometimes you may need to abort sooner without executing the remaining code. For this, Python  gives you a `break` statement that causes the program to exit the loop (of `if-elif-else` statement) immediately and to continue with the code after the loop. 

**Do exercise #4 to get the intuition.**

## Limiting number of attempts via _while_ loop
Let's put the player under some pressure! 


## Limiting number of attempts via _while_ loop (no break)


## For loop {#for-loop}

## Show remaining attempts

## Repeting the game

## Best score

## Lie, lie lie
Computer tells truth only with some probability.
