# Guess the Number, part 2 {#seminar03}

During our previous seminar, you programmed a single-attempt "Guess the Number" game. Now, you will learn about loops to allow for repeated attempts and about function to make your code modular and reliable.

## While loop {#while-loop}

## Playing until you win

## Counting attempts

## For loop {#for-loop}

## Limiting number of attempts via _for_ loop

## Limiting number of attempts via _while_ loop

## Limiting number of attempts via _while_ loop (no break)

## Show remaining attempts

## Repeting the game

## Best score

## Lie, lie lie
Computer tells truth only with some probability.
