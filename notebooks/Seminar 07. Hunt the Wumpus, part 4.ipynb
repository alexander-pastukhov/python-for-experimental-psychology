    "if the player is in the cave with Wumpus, draw a random number between 0 and 1. The function you are looking for is [random()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.random) and it is part of [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library, so the call is `random.random()`.If that number is smaller than probability that the Wumpus is scared, move it to a random adjacent cave (bats ignore Wumpus and it clings to the ceiling of the caves, so bottomless pits are not a problem for it). A useful function is [choice()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice), again, part of [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library. Otherwise, if Wumpus was not scared off, the player is eaten and game is over (the only outcome in exercise #1)."
