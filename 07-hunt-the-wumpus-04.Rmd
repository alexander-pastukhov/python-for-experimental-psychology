# Hunt the Wumpus, part 4 {#seminar07}

Our game is almost complete, we only need to add the Wumpus and arm the player with crooked arrows! Grab the [exercise notebook](notebooks/Seminar 07. Hunt the Wumpus, part 4.ipynb) and let get busy.

## Adding Wumpus.
By now you have added a player (single, location stored as in integer), bottomless pits (plural, locations stored in a list), and bats (plural as well). Add Wumpus! 

1. Create a new variable (`wumpus`?) and place Wumpus in an occupied cave. Print out location of Wumpus for debugging purposes.
2. Warn about Wumpus in the same code that warns about pits and bats. Canonical warning text is `"You smell a Wumpus!"`. 
3. Check if player is in the same cave as Wumpus. If that is the case, game is over, as the player is eaten by a hungry Wumpus. This is similar to _game-over_ due to falling into a bottomless pit. Think about whether the check should before or after check for bats.

## Giving player a chance.
Let us give player a chance. As they enter the cave with the Wumpus, they startle it. Then, Wumpus either runs away to a random adjacent cave (new) or stays put and eats the player. First, create a new constant that defines a probability that Wumpus runs away, e.g. `P_WUMPUS_SCARED`. In implementations I've found, it is typically 0.25, but use any value you feel is reasonable. 

Thus, if the player is in the cave with Wumpus, draw a random number between 0 and 1. The function you are looking for is [random()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.random) and it is part of [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library, so the call is `random.random()`.If that number is smaller than probability that the Wumpus is scared, move it to a random adjacent cave (bats ignore Wumpus and it clings to the ceiling of the caves, so bottomless pits are not a problem for it). A useful function is [choice()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice), again, part of [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library. Otherwise, if Wumpus was not scared off, the player is eaten and game is over (the only outcome in exercise #1).

## Flight of a crooked arrow
Our player is armed with _crooked_ arrows that can fly through caves. The rules for its flight are the following:

* The player decide in which cave it shoots an arrow and how far the arrow flies (from 1 up to 5 caves).
* Every time the arrow needs to flight into a next cave, that cave is picked randomly from adjacent caves _excluding_ the cave it came from (so, the arrow cannot make a 180Â° turn and there are only two out of three caves available for choosing).
* If the arrow flies into a cave with Wumpus, it is defeated and the game is won.
* If the arrow flies into a cave with the player, then they committed unintentional suicide and the game is lost.
* If the arrow reached it last cave (based on how far the player wanted to shoot) and the cave is empty, it drops down on the floor.
* Bats or bottomless pits have no effect on the arrow.

To keep track of the arrow, you will need following variables:

* `arrow`: current location of the arrow.
* `arrow_previous_cave`: index of the cave the arrow came from, so that you know where it cannot flight back.
* `shooting_distance`: remaining distance to travel.

For our first exercise, initialize 

* `arrow_previous_cave` to a random cave (at present, we don't care whether it is occupied, so any cave will do). 
* `arrow` to a random cave connected to `arrow_previous_cave` (you already implement this random choice for Wumpus in exercise #2)
* `shooting_distance` to
