# Introduction to the second part / semester {-}


Seminar outline:

1. Refresh your memory by implementing a Snake game.
2. Object-oriented programming: properties, method, constructors. We will re-implement the Snake game using OOP approach.
3. Duck-typing, special methods, interfaces for object properties, computed properties.
4. Iterators and generators in Python for generating pseudo-random trial sequences in experiments. Using staircase procedure to control difficulty of the task. We will use both in a "Guitar Hero" game clone (sans Guitars and Heroes).
5. Numpy library for matrices, mathematics, and linear algebra. We will implement a classic "Game of Life".
6. Pandas library for working with tables.
