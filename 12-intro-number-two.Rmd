# Introduction to the second part / semester {-}


## Grading
To pass the course, you need to complete all the assignments and score no less than 60% of points on each assignment. For a grade, you need the following percentages:

* 1.0: ≥95% of points on _each_ assignment.
* 1.3: ≥90%
* 1.7: ≥85%
* 2.0: ≥80%
* 2.3: ≥75%
* 2.7: ≥70%
* 3.0: ≥60%
* 4.0: <60%

## Seminar outline

1. Refresh your memory by implementing a Snake game.
2. Object-oriented programming: properties, method, constructors. We will re-implement the Snake game using OOP approach.
3. Duck-typing, special methods, interfaces for object properties, computed properties.
4. Iterators and generators in Python for generating pseudo-random trial sequences in experiments. Using staircase procedure to control difficulty of the task. We will use both in a "Guitar Hero" game clone (sans Guitars and Heroes).
5. Numpy library for matrices, mathematics, and linear algebra. We will implement a classic "Game of Life".
6. Pandas library for working with tables.
